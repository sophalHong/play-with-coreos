# play-with-coreos
This project is created to build, run and test CoreOS. It's just for learning.  
It's tested on Centos8, and Fedora32. Not recommend for Ubuntu Distribution since SELinux is used.

A demo of the start and destroy of a CoreOS VM can be found here: [README.md Demo section](#demo).

## Prerequisites
* `make`
* `virt-install`
* `Container Runtime`: Podman or Docker
* `libvirt`
* `SELinux`: Enforcing

## Hardware Requirements

* Virtualization Support
```shell
$ egrep '^flags.*(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
```
If this command resuls in nothing printed, your system does not support the relevant virtualization extensions. You can still use QEMU/KVM, but the emulator will fall back to software virtualization, which is much slower. (`--virt-type=qemu`)

* KVM kernel module
To verify that the KVM kernel modules are properly loaded:
```shell
$ lsmod | grep kvm
```
If this command lists kvm_intel or kvm_amd, KVM is properly configured.

## Quickstart
To start with the defaults, run the following:
```shell
$ make coreos
```

To start with customized variables:
```shell
$ NAME=vm-1 CPU=4 MEMORY=4096 DISK=2 IMAGE=/path/to/imgage YAML=/path/to/ignition.yaml make coreos
```

To Destroy:
```shell
$ make destroy
```

## Usage
Run `make help` to see available commands.
```shell
Usage: make [TARGET ...]

## Troubleshooting

### ioctl(KVM_CREATE_VM) failed: 16 Device or resource busy
This is caused by the virtualization technology is being locked by another hypervisor (ex: VirtualBox). To solved this problem, we just turn off running VirtualBox instance or run `virt-install` with option `--virt-type=qemu`. If closing VirtualBox doesn't fix it, you can stop the driver service with `sudo systemctl stop vboxdrv`.
